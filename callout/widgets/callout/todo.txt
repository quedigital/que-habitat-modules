// DONE: try saving an audio file
// DONE: default trigger to click
// DONE: turn off rectangle in the view (if it's off in the editor)
// DONE: for steps without an image, show a line of text
// DONE: <p> tags with Callout
// DONE: trigger: wait-for-audio (how does it work in the Player? I forget... [if there's no rect, it advances after audio plays, per Step.onAudioPlayed])
// DONE: put the Google Hangouts sample into Habitat
// DONE: inline-image pattern. not successful [patterns are block-level, it appears]
// DONE: when adding a new callout, the rect isn't always initialized correctly (ie, loses its size and position)
// TODONT: full-screen clickables (new trigger type; or trigger without rect?) [I think I was thinking of slides that wait for audio]
// DONE: Enter as a trigger (iPad?)
// DONE: added and reorganized asides
// DONE: text input
